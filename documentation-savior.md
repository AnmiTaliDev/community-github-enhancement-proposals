## Summary
Add a "Documentation Savior" achievement to celebrate developers who rescue projects from obscurity by providing clear, helpful documentation.

## Proposed Achievement
**Title**: Documentation Savior (Спаситель Документации)  
**Description**: "Добавил README файлы в 25+ репозиториев. Герои не всегда пишут код." / "Added README files to 25+ repositories. Heroes don't always write code."  
**Icon**: Superhero cape with a document/scroll, or lifesaver ring with text inside

### Achievement Tiers
- **Bronze**: 25+ repositories with quality README files
- **Silver**: 50+ repositories with comprehensive documentation  
- **Gold**: 100+ repositories with excellent documentation suites
- **Legendary**: 200+ repositories with outstanding documentation ecosystems

## Qualifying Criteria
- Added or significantly improved README files (not just minor edits)
- README must be substantial (minimum 200 words or equivalent content)
- Clear project description, installation instructions, and usage examples
- Contributions across different repositories (not just personal projects)
- Documentation must be in markdown or equivalent formatted text
- Sustained contributions over time

## Documentation Quality Standards
### Essential README Components

## Cultural Philosophy
### The Documentation Manifesto
"Code tells machines what to do. Documentation tells humans why and how." Documentation Saviors understand that great software without explanation is like a locked treasure chest—valuable but inaccessible.

### Professional Impact
Documentation skills are increasingly valued in professional development. This achievement recognizes that clear communication is as important as clean code.

## Benefits
- **Career development**: Documentation skills are professionally valuable
- **Community recognition**: Acknowledging often-overlooked contributions
- **Project success**: Better documentation leads to wider adoption
- **Knowledge sharing**: Contributing to collective learning
- **Accessibility**: Making technology more inclusive and approachable

The "Documentation Savior" celebrates developers who understand that the best code in the world is useless if nobody knows how to use it.
