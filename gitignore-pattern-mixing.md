# .gitignore Pattern Mixing for Multi-Technology Projects

## Summary
Allow combining multiple `.gitignore` templates during repository creation instead of selecting only one template.

## Current State
GitHub's repository creation currently allows selecting only one `.gitignore` template at a time, which is limiting for:
- Multi-language projects
- Full-stack applications
- Projects using multiple tools and frameworks

## Proposed Feature

### Pattern Mixing for .gitignore
Allow combining multiple `.gitignore` templates during repository creation:
- **Multi-select dropdown** instead of single selection
- **Smart conflict resolution** when patterns overlap
- **Preview functionality** to see the combined result
- **Popular combinations** as quick-select options

### Popular Combination Examples
- "Node.js + Docker + VS Code"
- "Python + Docker + JetBrains IDEs"
- "React + Node.js + Docker"
- "Jekyll + Node.js + GitHub Pages"
- "Java + Maven + IntelliJ IDEA"

## Use Cases

**Multi-technology projects:**
- Full-stack projects (React + Node.js + Docker)
- Multi-language repositories
- Projects using multiple tools (IDE + CI/CD + containerization)
- Microservices with different tech stacks
- **Documentation projects** (Jekyll + Node.js + GitHub Pages)

**Current workarounds:**
- Manually editing `.gitignore` after creation
- Copy-pasting from multiple sources
- Missing important patterns for secondary technologies

## Implementation Suggestion

**Repository Creation Flow:**
1. Choose primary language/framework (existing)
2. **NEW**: Select additional .gitignore patterns to mix
3. Preview generated combined `.gitignore` file
4. Create repository

**Smart Conflict Resolution:**
- Remove duplicate patterns automatically
- Merge related patterns intelligently
- Highlight any potential conflicts for user review

**Preview Functionality:**
- Show combined `.gitignore` content before creation
- Allow manual editing of the preview
- Save custom combinations for future use

## Benefits
- **Better coverage** for complex projects
- **Reduces manual configuration** after repository creation
- **Less copy-pasting** from multiple sources
- **Improved project setup experience**
- **Supports modern development workflows** with multiple technologies
