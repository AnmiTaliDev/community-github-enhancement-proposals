# Minimalist Achievement for GitHub

## Summary
Add a Minimalist achievement to celebrate developers who create highly efficient, concise projects that prove popular with the community.

## Proposed Achievement
**Title**: Минималист (Minimalist)  
**Description**: "Created a working project under 100 lines of code with 50+ stars. Brevity is the soul of wit."  
**Icon**: Clean, geometric design with minimal lines forming a star

### Achievement Tiers
- **Bronze**: 50+ stars, <100 lines of code
- **Silver**: 100+ stars, <100 lines of code  
- **Gold**: 250+ stars, <100 lines of code
- **Legendary**: 500+ stars, <100 lines of code

## Qualifying Criteria
- Project must have fewer than 100 lines of actual code (excluding comments, blank lines, config files)
- Minimum 50 GitHub stars to prove community value
- Must be a functional, working project (not just a snippet)
- Original code (not a fork)
- Project must solve a real problem or provide utility

## Rationale
### Celebrates Key Programming Principles
- **Elegant simplicity**: Solving complex problems with minimal code
- **Code efficiency**: Maximum impact with minimum resources
- **Clean architecture**: Well-structured, readable solutions
- **Community value**: Proving usefulness through adoption

### Typical Recipients
- Utility library creators (string formatters, date helpers)
- Command-line tool developers
- JavaScript one-liners that solve common problems
- CSS/HTML snippet creators
- Algorithm implementation specialists
- Configuration file generators

## Benefits
- **Quality over quantity**: Encourages thoughtful, efficient coding
- **Learning tool**: Showcases how to write concise, effective code
- **Community service**: Recognizes creators of useful micro-tools
- **Best practices**: Promotes clean, readable code standards

## Implementation
- Analyze repository file content and count actual code lines
- Track star count progression over time
- Verify project functionality through community engagement
- Display code line count and star ratio in achievement
- Exclude generated code, dependencies, and configuration files

The "Minimalist" celebrates the art of doing more with less - proving that sometimes the smallest solutions make the biggest impact.
